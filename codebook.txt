*****************STUDY DESIGN****************************************

Description about how data was collected to generate the  tidy data step by step
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
a)studied the datasets in X*,Y* and subject* text files
b)read the above data sets for both Test and Train datasets
c)merged the data sets for both Test and Train based on  X,Y and subject.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
a) Here the aim was to just extract variables which have mean or std deviation values contained. Extracted using the grep() function.
b) merged X data set with mean and std values.

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
a) Variables used for Test and Train data are contained in features.txt. Read the variables and assigned them to the data collected for X for both Test and Train.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
a) merged the data of Z,Y,X ie subject,label other X variables with mean and std data.
b) read the data from activity_labels.txt
c) used the number of the label/activity in above merged data and fetched the respective name from activity_labels.txt after reading.

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
a) Melted merged data into long format with "subject" and "label" as IDs in a below format:
  subject  label          variable     value
1       1 LAYING tBodyAcc-mean()-X 0.4034743
2       1 LAYING tBodyAcc-mean()-X 0.2783732
b)Then using the mean as function, in "dcast" function from reshape2 library, transformed the data to wide format per subject and per activity basis.
c) Arranged the data
d)Renamed the variables with average values as ave.<old_variable_name> format.
e) Generated the tidy data set in a text file "CourseProjectTidyData.txt"  

*****************CODE BOOK****************************************
All the variables in tidy dataset "CourseProjectTidyData.txt" except subject and label are the average values of the variables of the merged data. So,
the average value of tBodyAcc-mean()-X -> ave.tBodyAcc-mean()-X
Since tidy data contains only the average values all the variables are mapped as :

Old_Variable_Name	New_Variable_Name
"tBodyAcc-mean()-X"     "ave.tBodyAcc-mean()-X"             
"tBodyAcc-mean()-Y"     "ave.tBodyAcc-mean()-Y"           
"tBodyAcc-mean()-Z" 	"ave.tBodyAcc-mean()-Z"
"tBodyAcc-std()-X"  	"ave.tBodyAcc-std()-X"                  
"tBodyAcc-std()-Y"	"ave.tBodyAcc-std()-Y"
"tBodyAcc-std()-Z"  	"ave.tBodyAcc-std()-Z"                  
"tBodyAcc-mad()-X"	"ave.tBodyAcc-mad()-X"
"tBodyAcc-mad()-Y"	"ave.tBodyAcc-mad()-Y"                    
"tBodyAcc-mad()-Z"	"ave.tBodyAcc-mad()-Z"
