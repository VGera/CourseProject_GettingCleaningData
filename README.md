# CourseProject_GettingCleaningData
This Repo contains the code for the project named run_analysis.R, codebook and README.md 
codebook has description of the Study Design and variables in the tidy Dataset.

In order to run the run_analysis.R, the dataset "getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset" and run_analysis.R are to be placed in the same folder. Change the working directory to where Test and Train folders are pointing.
In my case I changed the working directory to : 

~getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset/UCI HAR Dataset
